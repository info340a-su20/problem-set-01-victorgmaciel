    <img src="img/vegeta.jpg" alt="Fictional character with black colored hair from the anime series Dragon Ball Z/GT/Super">

    <p>Vegeta is one of the last survivors of the saiyan race. Early in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vegeta">DragonBall Z</a> series he is protrayed as a stubborn,
        villainous character who will stop at nothing to obtain absolute power. It is only after being humbled by various
        fighters and Kakorat(Goku) that Vegeta morphs into the anti-hero that he is known for today.
